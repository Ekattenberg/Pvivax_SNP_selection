# Pvivax_SNP_selection

This github contains an example jupyter notebook with python3 code to perform the SNP selection steps for a barcode for molecular surveillance as explained in the manuscript "Novel highly-multiplexed AmpliSeq targeted assay for Plasmodium vivax genetic surveillance use cases at multiple geographical scales" by Kattenberg et al. 2022. 

If you use the same SNP selection procedure, please cite our paper (publication details will follow as soon as accepted).
